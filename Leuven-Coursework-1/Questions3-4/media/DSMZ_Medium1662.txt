Dissolve ingredients (except carbonate, crotonate and sulfide), adjust pH to 8.5 and
sparge medium with 100% N2 gas for 30 – 45 min to make it anoxic. Add crotonate and
sulfide from sterile anoxic stock solutions prepared under 100% N2 gas and carbonate
from a sterile stock solution prepared under 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture. The
crotonate solution should be sterilized by filtration. Adjust pH of the complete medium to
9.0, if necessary.
