Solution A:
 Peptone                                                           10.0        g
 Meat extract                                                       3.0        g
 NaCl                                                               5.0        g
 D(+)-Trehalose                                                     1.0        g
 Agar if appropriate                                               19.0        g
 Tap water                                                        250.0       ml
Sea water*                                                        750.0       ml

Dissolve beef extract and peptone by heating in tap water, adjust pH to 7.8 and boil for
10 min. Readjust pH to 7.3. Add agar and autoclave at 121C for 20 min. Directly after
autoclaving, add warm (55C) sterile sea water. Liquid medium without agar should be
combined when cooled to room temperature.

 Natural sea water is stored in the dark for at least three weeks to "age". If natural sea
water is not available use artificial sea water:
