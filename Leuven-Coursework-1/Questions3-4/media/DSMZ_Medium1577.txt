Dissolve ingredients (except cysteine, magnesium sulfate, bicarbonate, glucose and
sulfide), then sparge medium with 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture for 30 – 45 min to
make it anoxic. Add and dissolve cysteine, adjust pH to 6.0, dispense under 80% N2 and
20% CO2 gas atmosphere into anoxic Hungate-type tubes or serum vials and autoclave.
After sterilization add magnesium sulfate, glucose and sulfide from sterile anoxic stock
solutions prepared under 100% N2 gas and bicarbonate from a sterile anoxic stock
solution prepared under 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas atmosphere. Prior to inoculation
check pH of complete medium and adjust to 6.8 – 7.0, if necessary.
Note: This medium cannot be stored over a longer period and should be prepared freshly
before use!
