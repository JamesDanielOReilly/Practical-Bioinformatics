Before autoclaving adjust pH to 7.0 with NaOH.
For solid medium sterilize the MgCl2 x 6 H2O dissolved in 500 ml distilled water by
autoclaving. Dissolve the remaining ingredients in 500 ml distilled water (including 20.0
g agar), sterilise by autoclaving, cool to about 50°C and then mix with the warm sterile
MgCl2 solution before pouring the plates.
