Dissolve ingredients (except bicarbonate, carbonate, trace elements, ferric citrate,
magnesium chloride and vitamins) and sparge medium with 100% N2 gas for 30 – 45
min to make it anoxic. Add and dissolve bicarbonate and carbonate, then adjust pH to
9.5 and dispense medium under 100% N2 gas atmosphere into anoxic Hungate-type
tubes or serum vials and autoclave. Add ferric citrate (10% w/v stock solution; dissolve
by boiling and adjust pH to 7.5-8.0), trace elements, selenite-tungstate solution,
magnesium chloride and vitamins from sterile anoxic stock solutions prepared under
100% N2 gas. Sterilize vitamins by filtration. Adjust pH of the complete medium to 9.5, if
necessary.
