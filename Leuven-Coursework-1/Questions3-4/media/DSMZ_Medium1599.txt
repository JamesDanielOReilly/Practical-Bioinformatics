Dissolve ingredients (except carbonates, acetate and sulfide) and sparge medium with
100% N2 gas for 30 – 45 min to make it anoxic. Then, add and dissolve bicarbonate and
carbonate, adjust pH to 9.5, dispense under 100% N2 gas atmosphere into anoxic
Hungate-type tubes or serum vials and autoclave. After sterilization add acetate and
sulfide from sterile anoxic stock solutions autoclaved under 100% N2 gas atmosphere.
Adjust pH of complete medium to 9.5 – 9.7, if necessary.
