Dissolve ingredients except methanol and dithiothreitol. Adjust pH to 7.5 with 1 N NaOH
and sparge medium with 100% N2 gas for 30 – 45 min to make it anoxic. Distribute
medium under 100% N2 gas atmosphere into anoxic Hungate-type tubes or serum vials
to 30% of their volume and autoclave. After sterilization add methanol from a sterile
anoxic stock solution autoclaved under 100% N2 gas atmosphere and dithiothreitol from
an anoxic stock solution sterilized by filtration. Prior to use check pH of complete
medium and adjust to 7.6 – 7.8, if necessary. After inoculation, add sterile 80% H2 and
20% CO2 gas mixture to 0.5 bar overpressure. After growth becomes visible
overpressure of 80% H2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture can be increased to 1 bar.
Note: Use 10% (v/v) as inoculum.
