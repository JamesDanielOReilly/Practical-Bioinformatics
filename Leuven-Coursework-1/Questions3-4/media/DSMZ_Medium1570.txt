Vitamins solution (see medium 141)                                   10.00    ml
Distilled water                                                    1000.00    ml

Dissolve ingredients (except phosphate buffer, thiosulfate, bicarbonate and vitamins) and
sparge medium with 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture for 30 - 45 min to make it anoxic.
Dispense medium under same gas atmosphere into anoxic Hungate-type tubes or serum
vials up to a volume of 20% and autoclave. Add phosphate buffer, thiosulfate, bicarbonate,
and vitamin solution to the autoclaved medium from sterile anoxic stock solutions prepared
under 100% N2 gas. Phosphate buffer, stock solutions of vitamins and thiosulfate are
sterilized by filtration and stored under N2, whereas the solution of bicarbonate is prepared
under 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture and autoclaved. Adjust pH of the complete
medium to 6.7, if necessary. After inoculation pressurize vessels to 0.5 bar overpressure
with sterile 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture and add sterile air in an amount that is
equivalent to a volume of 20% of the headspace.

Phosphate buffer:
