Dissolve ingredients except bicarbonate, pyruvate, vitamins, thiosulfate and sulfide, then
sparge medium with 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture for 30 – 45 min to make it
anoxic. Dispense medium under same gas atmosphere into anoxic Hungate-type tubes
or serum vials and autoclave. Add pyruvate, vitamins, thiosulfate and sulfide from sterile
anoxic stock solutions prepared under 100% N2 gas and bicarbonate from a sterile
anoxic stock solution prepared under 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture. Stock solutions
of pyruvate, vitamins and thiosulfate should be sterilized by filtration. Prior to use adjust
pH of complete medium to 7.3 - 7.5, if necessary.
