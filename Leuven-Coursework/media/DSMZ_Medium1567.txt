Solution 4 (vitamine solution)                                    1.0      ml
Solution 5 (NaCl)                                                66.0      ml
Solution 6 (Fe EDTA))                                             0.4      ml

Bring to 1 liter with distilled water.

Prepare the growth medium as follows:
Dilute 100 ml solution 1 to 1 litre with distilled water and then add 1 ml of solution 3,
66 ml solution 5 and 0.4 ml of solution 6. Dispense the medium into the growth vessels.
If using sealed vessels it is appropriate to add 50% methane to the gas phase and
autoclave at 121C (15psi) for 15 minutes. Autoclave the phosphate buffer separately.
Filter sterilized the vitamin solution. When the growth medium is cool 1.0 ml/l vitamin
solution and 10 ml/l of the phosphate buffer are added - if too warm the phosphate will
precipitate. Liquid cultures should be grown with shaking.
