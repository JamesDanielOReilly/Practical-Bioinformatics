1555. Medium for tick cells (Rickettsia)

Cultivation of IRE11 cells for infection with Rickettsia monacensis

L15C (Modified Leibovitzs' L15) used to culture host cells (IRE11). L15C medium is a
modification of L15B medium, previously described in detail (Munderloh UG, Kurtti TJ.
1989. Formulation of medium for tick cell culture. Exp. Appl. Acarol. 7:219–29).

Alterations were made to the following reagents:
L-aspartic acid                                                  0.4485   g/L
L-glutamine                                                         0.5   g/L
L-proline                                                          0.45   g/L
L-glutamic acid                                                    0.25   g/L
ketoglutaric acid                                              0.4485   g/L
D-glucose                                                        18.018   g/L
NaOH                                                                  5   mM

Prior to use in supplemented medium, L15C was diluted by the addition of 33 % water
by volume.
Supplemented L15C medium is used with
Foetal Bovine Serum                                              10 %
Tryptose Phosphate Broth                                          5%
lipoprotein concentrate (LPC; MPBiomedical)                     0.1 %
HEPES                                                            25 mM
NaHCO3                                                         0.25 %
The pH is adjusted to pH 7.5 using 1 M NaOH.

This medium and the cultivation of tick cells is described in the “Basic Tick Cell Culture
Methods“ provided as pdf-file (see strain entry for DSM 29017: cultivation conditions)
by Tim Kurtti & Uli Munderloh, University of Minnesota.

Infection with Rickettsia monacensis or R. buchneri:
One 25 cm2 flask of well-grown cells is infected with 1 ml of the Rickettsia strain (quickly
thawed from -80°C) and centrifuged for 1 h onto the cell layer at 1600 rpm at 20°C.
Incubate at 30°C with closed lid (without CO2) and look for bacteria and destroyed cells
after 4-6 days.
