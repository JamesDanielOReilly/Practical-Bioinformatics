Distilled water                                               890.00      ml

pH 5.0

pH is adjusted to 9.0 by adding 100 ml/l 1M sterilized NaHCO3 and 10 ml/l 1M sterilized
Na2CO3. 5 ml/l sterile methanol is added to the cooled medium. When preparing liquid
media cool the mineral salts solution, Na2CO3 solution and NaHCO3 solution to room
temperature before mixing. When preparing agar add 2.0 % agar to the mineral salts
solution and autoclave. Cool the Na2CO3 solution, NaHCO3 solution and agar to 50-55C
before mixing.
