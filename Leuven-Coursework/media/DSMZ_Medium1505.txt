Dissolve ingredients (except carbonates and thioglycolate), then sparge medium with
100% N2 gas for 30 - 45 min to make it anoxic. Add carbonate and hydrogencarbonate,
adjust pH to 8.5 – 9.0, dispense medium under 100% N2 gas atmosphere into anoxic
Hungate-type tubes or serum vials and autoclave. After autoclaving add thioglycolate
from an anoxic stock solution prepared under 100% N2 gas and sterilized by filtration.
