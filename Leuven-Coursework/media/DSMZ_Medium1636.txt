Dissolve ingredients (except calcium chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, vitamins and
sulfide), then sparge medium with 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture for 30 – 45 min to
make it anoxic. Dispense medium under same gas atmosphere into anoxic Hungate-type
tubes or serum vials and autoclave. After autoclaving add calcium chloride, glucose,
vitamins and sulfide from sterile anoxic stock solutions prepared under 100% N2 gas and
bicarbonate from a sterile stock solution prepared under 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas
mixture. The vitamin solution should be sterilized by filtration. Adjust pH of the complete
medium to 7.4, if necessary.
