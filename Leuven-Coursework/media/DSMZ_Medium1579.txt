Dissolve ingredients (except yeast extract, nitrate, bicarbonate and vitamins) and sparge
medium with 100% CO2 gas for at least 30 – 45 min to make it anoxic, then dispense
under same gas atmosphere into anoxic Hungate-type tubes or serum vials and
autoclave. After autoclaving add yeast extract, nitrate and vitamins from sterile anoxic
stock solutions prepared under 100% N2 gas and bicarbonate from a sterile anoxic stock
solution prepared under 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas atmosphere. Vitamins should be
sterilized by filtration. The pH of the complete medium should be adjusted to 6.5 – 6.8,
if necessary.
