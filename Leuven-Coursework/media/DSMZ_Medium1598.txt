Prepare the growth medium as follows:
1. Dilute 100 ml NMS salt solution to 1 litre with distilled water and then add 1 ml of
  FeNaEDTA solution and 1 ml of the trace elements and autoclave. Also autoclave the
  phosphate buffer stock solution.
2. After cooling of the autoclaved solutions, add 20ml phosphate buffer stock solution to
   the mineral solution.
3. Dispense 9ml distilled water into the growth vessels. Use sealed vessels it is
   appropriate to add 10% methane and 1% CO2 gas to the gas phase and autoclave.
4. When the growth vessels is cool, 1.0 ml of the mineral medium and 0.1 ml
   0.03 M Cerium-(III)-chlorid are added.
5. Adjust pH to 3.5 with 1M HCL to obtain the final mineral medium before inoculate.
6. The cultures should be grown with shaking.
