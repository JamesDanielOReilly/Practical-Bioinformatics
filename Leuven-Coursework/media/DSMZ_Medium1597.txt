Solution I:

Solution J:
Na2S x 9 H2O                                                          0.25    g
Distilled water                                                      10.00   ml

Sterilize solutions A and B in closed thick-walled screw-top bottles (e.g., SCHOTT) for 20
min at 120°C. The pH of solution A after sterilization should be 10. There is some
precipitate forming that settles at the bottom after 3 – 4 days. It is best to remove
precipitates by decantation before using solution A for medium preparation.
Combine solution A with solution B and sparge medium with 100% N2 gas for at least 30
– 45 min to make it anoxic, then dispense under same gas atmosphere into anoxic
Hungate-type tubes or serum vials and autoclave. Solutions C to J are sterilized
separately under 100% N2 gas. Vitamins and coenzyme M should be sterilized by
filtration. To complete the medium appropriate amounts of solutions C to J are added to
the combined sterile solutions A and B in the sequence as indicated. Final pH of the
medium should be 9.5.
Note: Addition of 10 - 20 mg sodium dithionite per liter (e.g. from 5% (w/v) solution,
freshly prepared under N2 and filter-sterilized) may stimulate growth at the beginning. For
transfers use 5 - 10% inoculum.
