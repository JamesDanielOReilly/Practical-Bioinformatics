Dissolve ingredients (except bicarbonate, fumarate and vitamins) and sparge medium
with 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture to make it anoxic. Dispense medium under same
gas atmosphere into anoxic Hungate-type tubes or serum vials and autoclave. After
autoclaving complete the medium by adding fumarate and vitamins from sterile anoxic
stock solutions prepared under 100% N2 gas and bicarbonate from a sterile anoxic stock
solution prepared under 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture. Stock solutions of fumarate
and vitamins are sterilized by filtration. Adjust pH of the complete medium to 7.0 - 7.2,
if necessary.
