Solution C:
  FeSO4 x 7 H2O                                                     15.40     g
  Na2S x 9 H2O                                                      13.20     g
  Distilled water                                                  100.00 ml
Heat distilled water to 50°C in a 250 ml beaker with a stir bar present. While rapidly
stirring the water, add the ferrous sulfate followed immediately by the sodium sulfide.
The formed black FeS sludge is decanted into a glass bottle that can be stoppered. The
FeS is allowed to settle for several hours and then the overlying water is decanted and
replaced. This procedure is repeated at least five times to wash the FeS. After washing,
the pH of the FeS solution should be close to neutrality. The FeS suspension can be kept
in closed bottles or tubes under a nitrogen atmosphere for at least three months.

Preparation of the bottom layer: Mix 1 volume of solution A with 1 volume of solution
C and add 1% (w/v) agarose. After autoclaving, aseptically fill 1.2 ml of the suspension
in sterile screw capped tubes (10 ml total volume). The bottom layer solidifies in approx.
30 min.
Preparation of the top layer: Add bicarbonate and low melt agarose to solution A and
autoclave. Let the sterile solution cool to 40°C and add 10.00 ml/l of solution B. Sparge
solution with sterile 100% CO2 gas until a pH of 6.1 – 6.4 is reached. Then, aseptically
pipette aliquots of 6.0 ml over the bottom layer of each tube and let medium equilibrate
for at least three hours, but not longer than 12 hours.
Inoculation: Inoculate the semisolid top layer with a pipette that is inserted just above
the FeS layer; the pipette tip is drawn upward as the inoculum is dispensed.
