 Trace mineral element solution (see medium 941)                 1          mL
 Resazurin (0.1%)                                                1          mL
 Distilled water                                           1000.00          ml

pH 7.0

Add after autoclave

MgCl2 x 6 H2O (150.0 g/l)                                       20   ml/l
NaHCO3 (10%)                                                    20   ml/l
Na2S x 9 H2O (2%)                                               20   ml/l
Glucose (1M)                                                    20   ml/l



Prepare the medium without NaHCO3, Na2S x 9 H2O, MgCl2 x 6 H2O and glucose. Boil the
medium in a water bath and cool under a stream of N2/CO2 (80/20). Add the NaHCO3 to
the cooled medium (the pH should be 7.0) and dispense the medium into Hungate tubes
or serum bottles under a stream of N2/CO2 (80/20). Seal the tubes under N2/CO2 (80/20)
and autoclave. To the cooled medium at the appropriate amounts of Na2S x 9 H2O, MgCl2
x 6 H2O and glucose from sterile, anaerobic stock solutions.
