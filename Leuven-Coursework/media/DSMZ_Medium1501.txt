 Distilled water                                               100.00      ml

May be stored at 4C in the dark

Phosphate buffer:
 Na2HPO4 x 12 H2O                                               71.60       g
 KH2PO4                                                         26.00       g
 Distilled water                                              1000.00      ml

Dissolve in about 800 ml of water, adjust the pH to 6.8 and make up to 1 litre.

Prepare the growth medium as follows:
Dilute 100 ml solution 1 to 1 litre with 2% NaCl and then add 1 ml of solution 3, 1 ml of
the trace elements, and 0.1 ml of solution 2. If solid media is required add 1.5% agar.
Dispense the medium into the growth vessels. If using sealed vessels it is appropriate to
add 25% methane to the gas phase and autoclave at 121C (15psi) for 15 minutes.
Autoclave the phosphate buffer separately. When the growth medium is cool 10 ml/l of
the phosphate buffer is added - if too warm the phosphate will precipitate. Liquid
cultures should be grown with shaking.
