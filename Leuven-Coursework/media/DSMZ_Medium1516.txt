Prepare the liquid medium. Boil the medium in a water bath and cool under N2 to room
temperature. Adjust to pH 5.8-6.2. Dispense the medium into Hungate tubes or serum
bottles under gassing with N2. Sterilize by autoclaving. Before inoculation add from
sterile stock solutions:

Filtrate of Desulfurococcus kamchatkensis (DSM18924)(see below)          10.0 ml
Vitamin Solution (see medium 141)                                        10.0 ml
Na2SxH2O                                                                  0.3 g

Filtrate:
Strain DSM 18924 was inoculated into anaerobic tube, containing 10ml of the medium
mentioned above. Glucose (2g/l) and yeast extract (0,6g/l) were added as substrate.
After 3 days of incubation culture was filtered throuth 0,22nm filter. Filtered culture
broth is used for the cultivation of the strain at a concentration of 1% as a source of
growth factor
