      (STRAINS FROM SOIL)


Solution A:
NH4Cl                                                              535      mg
KH2PO4                                                              54      mg
KCl                                                                 74      mg
MgSO4 x 7 H2O                                                       49      mg
CaCl2 x 2 H2O                                                      147      mg
NaCl                                                               584      mg
Trace element solution                                               1      ml
Cresol red solution                                                  2      ml
Distilled water                                                ad 1000      ml

Autoclave, subsequently adjust pH of the medium to about 7.8 by addition of sterile
10% NaHCO3 (medium is turning from yellow to pink).
Important: During growth, add NaHCO3 to readjust pH as soon as pH indicator changes
to yellow. For stock cultures, 5 g l-1 CaCO3 (will stay as a precipitate) or 4.8 g l-1 HEPES
may be added to keep pH neutral for a longer time.
Aeration must be adjusted according to the density and activity of the culture. At low cell
concentrations (which is the case most of the time) cells are sensitive to strong aeration
(don’t shake the cultures).
