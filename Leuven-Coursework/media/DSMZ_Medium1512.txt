Working Medium
Combine Solutions A, B and C and add
Fetal Bovine Serum (heat-inactivated, 56°C, 30 min)                 100         ml


Maintenance conditions
Infected amoeba cultures can be maintained e.g. in 25 cm2 flasks (e.g. Nunc flasks,
VWR, 734-2081, Thermo-Scientific, 156340) at 20-30°C in an incubator (no special
requirements concerning CO2 or light).



Maintenance/Passage of infected amoeba cultures
Infected Acanthamoeba cultures don’t have to be transferred to fresh culture flasks as
frequently as usually done for mammalian cell cultures. Amoeba cultures can be
maintained in the same flask for several weeks or months. However, if the cultures reach
a high cell density, medium should be exchanged. For that purpose amoebae are
detached from the surface of the flask by knocking at the culture flask (no trypsin
required, amoebae are only weakly adherent compared to most mammalian cells) and
the medium (containing the majority of cells) is then completely removed. Fresh medium
is added and the few remaining attached amoebae will continue to grow.
Alternatively, cultures can also be passaged regularly (e.g. weekly) by transfer of a small
aliquot of a densely grown culture (after cell detachment, as described above) to a fresh
flask containing medium.

If cultures contain few attached cells, but high amounts of cell debris, medium should be
exchanged without prior cell detachment. Cultures usually recover fast.
Depending on the host cell strain, the bacteria may cause host cell lysis. To maintain
such cultures, bacteria have to be transferred by adding culture supernatant
(approximately 0.5 ml) to fresh culture flasks containing uninfected host cells
(approximately semi-confluent culture) each 7-10 days.

Storage
Bacteria released from host cells can be stored in

Sucrose-Phosphate-Glutamate buffer
Sucrose                                                            75         g
KH2PO4                                                             0.52       g
Na2HPO4 x 2H2O                                                     1.53       g
Glutamic acid                                                      0.75       g
Distilled water                                                    1000       ml

at -80°C for several months.

Infected cell cultures (supplemented with 10% DMSO) are best stored in liquid nitrogen.
