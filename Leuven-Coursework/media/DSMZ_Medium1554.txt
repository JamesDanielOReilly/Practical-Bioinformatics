 HEPES buffer solution (see below)                                10.00 ml
 NH4Cl                                                             0.05  g
 NaHCO3                                                            0.25  g
 Catalase (SIGMA C1345)                                            2.50 mg
 Vitamin solution (see medium 141)                                10.00 ml
 Distilled water                                                1000.00 ml

Dissolve ingredients (except trace elements,HEPES buffer, ammonium chloride catalase
and vitamin solution), dispense medium into Erlenmeyer flasks with screw caps (e.g., 20
ml medium per 100 ml flask) and autoclave. Add HEPES buffer and ammonium chloride
from stock solutions sterilized by autoclaving. Trace elements, bicarbonate, and vitamins
are added from stock solutions sterilized by filtration. Adjust pH of the complete medium
to 7.5 using sterile solutions of bicarbonate (5% w/v) or 1 N HCl. After inoculation, add
to the medium 5 – 10 units/ml catalase from a 1.00 mg/ml stock solution freshly
prepared in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) and sterilized by filtration.
Note: Use at least 5 - 10% (v/v) inoculum and incubate in the dark without shaking.

HEPES buffer solution:
 NaOH (pellets)                                                  24.00     g
 HEPES (free acid)                                              238.40     g
 Distilled water                                               1000.00 ml
Fist dissolve NaOH in ca 600 ml water, then add HEPES, adjust pH to 7.6 -7.7 and fill up
to 1000 ml volume.
