Dissolve ingredients (except ferric citrate, bicarbonate and vitamins) and sparge medium
with 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture for 30 – 45 min to make it anoxic. Dispense
medium under same gas atmosphere into anoxic Hungate-type tubes or serum vials and
autoclave. Add ferric citrate (dissolve by boiling and adjust pH to 6.5 – 7.0) and vitamins
from sterile anoxic stock solutions prepared under 100% N2 gas and bicarbonate from a
sterile anoxic stock solution prepared under 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture. Sterilize
vitamins by filtration. Adjust pH of the complete medium to 6.5, if necessary.



For DSM 103037 supplement autoclaved medium with 0.41 g/l Na-acetate, 0.34 g/l Na-
formate, 1.00 g/l D-glucose and 0.10 g/l Na2S x 9 H2O added from sterile anoxic stock
solutions. Reduce amount of bicarbonate to 1.00 g/l and adjust pH of complete medium
to 5.5 – 6.0.
