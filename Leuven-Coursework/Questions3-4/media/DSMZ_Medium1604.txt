First dissolve ferric citrate in water by heating and adjust to pH 6.0, then add other
medium ingredients except ferrous chloride, vitamins and cysteine. Sparge medium with
80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture for 30 – 45 min to make it anoxic, then dispense
medium under same gas atmosphere into anoxic Hungate-type tubes or serum vials and
autoclave. Add ferrous chloride (dissolved in 0.1 N HCl), vitamins (sterilized by filtration)
and cysteine from sterile anoxic stock solutions prepared under 100% N2 gas. Prior to
inoculation check pH and adjust to 6.0, if necessary.
