Dissolve ingredients of solution A except carbonates, sparge with 100% N2 gas for 30 -
45 min to make it anoxic, then add bicarbonate and carbonate, adjust pH to 9.0,
dispense under same gas atmosphere into anoxic Hungate-type tubes or serum vials and
autoclave.
                                                                 Continued on next page

Prior to inoculation complete the medium by adding appropriate amounts of sterile
solutions B to H prepared under 100% N2 gas atmosphere. Adjust pH of the complete
medium to 8.7 – 9.0, if necessary.
