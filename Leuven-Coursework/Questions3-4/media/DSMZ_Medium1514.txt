Filter-sterilize


Maintenance conditions of SF-9 cells (see also DSMZ catalogue for ACC 125)
SF-9 cells are cultivated at 25 – 29°C without the addition of CO2 in flasks (25 cm2) with
tightly closed lids. When a confluent layer has formed, infection can be carried out.


Infection with Rhabdochlamydiae
Exchange medium and add 500 – 1000 µl of EB stock solution (thawed quickly to 37°C).
Centrifuge for 1 h onto the cell layer at 1600 rpm at 20°C.


Maintenance/Passage of infected insect cell cultures
Infected cultures can be maintained e.g. in 25 cm2 flasks (e.g. Nunc flasks, VWR, 734-
2081) at 27°C in an incubator (no special requirements concerning CO2 or light).

If the percentage of infected cells is still low (which might occur initially after inoculation
of cultures with bacteria from a frozen stock) infected cultures may be maintained by
weekly passage (1:5). Infection of yet uninfected cells by added bacteria or bacteria
released from neighboring infected cells is facilitated by centrifugation (130 x g, 15 min)
of the culture flask.
In well-infected cultures host cell lysis will be visible (the bacteria cause host cell lysis
within approximately 5-7 days after invasion of host cells). To maintain such cultures,
bacteria have to be transferred by adding culture supernatant (approximately 0.5-1 ml)
to fresh culture flasks containing uninfected insect cells (approximately semi-confluent
culture) each 7-10 days.


Storage
Bacteria released from host cells can be stored in

Sucrose-Phosphate-Glutamate buffer
Sucrose                                                                 75          g
KH2PO4                                                                  0.52        g
Na2HPO4 x 2H2O                                                          1.53        g
Glutamic acid                                                           0.75        g
Distilled water                                                         1000        ml

at -80°C for several months.

Infected cell cultures (supplemented with 10% DMSO) are best stored in liquid nitrogen.
