Dissolve sodium chloride and hydrogenphosphate, then sparge solution with 100% N2
gas for at least 30 – 45 min to make it anoxic. Add and dissolve hydrogencarbonate and
carbonate while gassing the head space only, then dispense under 100% N2 gas
atmosphere into anoxic Hungate-type tubes or serum vials and autoclave. After
autoclaving add ammonium chloride, magnesium sulfate, trace elements, formate,
acetate, yeast extract, vitamins and sulfide from sterile anoxic stock solutions prepared
under 100% N2 gas. Vitamins should be sterilized by filtration. The pH of the complete
medium should be 9.5.
Note: Addition of 10 - 20 mg sodium dithionite per liter (e.g. from 5% (w/v) solution,
freshly prepared under N2 and filter-sterilized) may stimulate growth at the beginning. For
transfers use 5 - 10% inoculum.
