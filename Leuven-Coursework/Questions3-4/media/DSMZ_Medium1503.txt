1503. CULTIVATION MEDIUM FOR CHLAMYDOPHILA PECORUM

Cultivation of CACO-2 cells (ACC 169)
 MEM-Medium                                                      45.0      ml
 Fetal Bovine Serum                                               5.0      ml
 Aminoacids (100 x)                                               0.5      ml

Filter-sterilize (0.2 µm) and keep no longer than 4 weeks. Store at room temperature to
facilitate detection of contamination.

Prepare a 25 cm2 flask and seed cells according to standard protocols (see DSMZ
catalogue for ACC 169). Incubate at 37°C plus 5% CO2. When a confluent layer has
formed, infection can be carried out.

Exchange medium with 6 ml of Infection Medium (as above with the addition of 1 µg/ml
cycloheximide (final concentration)) and add 500 – 1000 µl of EB stock solution (thawed
quickly to 37°C).

Centrifuge for 1 h onto the cell layer at 1600 rpm at 20°C.

Incubate at 37°C + 5% CO2. Control cells daily and look for inclusions. Not all
Chlamydiae form well-visible inclusions, ultimately, immunofluorescence or in situ-
hybridization techniques are necessary to visualize inclusions.
