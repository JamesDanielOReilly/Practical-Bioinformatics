Dissolve ingredients except bicarbonate, vitamins, cysteine and sulfide, then sparge
medium with 80% H2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture for 30 – 45 min to make it anoxic. Add
and dissolve bicarbonate, then dispense medium under 80% H2 and 20% CO2 gas
atmosphere into anoxic Hungate-type tubes or serum vials and autoclave. Add vitamins,
cysteine and sulfide from sterile anoxic stock solutions prepared under 100% N2 gas.
The vitamin solution should be sterilized by filtration. Prior to use check pH of complete
medium and adjust to 6.8 - 7.0, if necessary. After growth has started and the culture is
becoming turbid add sterile 80% H2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture to 0.5 - 1 bar
overpressure.



For DSM 1093 supplement medium after autoclaving with 0.50 g/l coenzyme M (2-
mercaptoethanesulfonic acid) added from a filter-sterilized anoxic stock solution
prepared under N2.

For DSM 2640, DSM 2702, DSM 3823, DSM 4140, DSM 4179, DSM 4273, DSM 4274 and
DSM 10196 increase amount of Na-acetate to 4.00 g/l.

For DSM 15163 adjust pH of complete medium to 6.0.
