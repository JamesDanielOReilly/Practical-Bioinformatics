Trace element solution (see below)                                1.00      ml
CuSO4                                                             0.02       g
Distilled water                                                 1000.0      ml

Dispense the medium into the culture vessels. For small volumes serum bottles or
Hungate tubes may be used. The gas phase to liquid ratio should be about 1:10. Use a
gas phase containing air, 10-20% methane and 5-10% CO2 and autoclave at 121C for
15 minutes. When the growth medium is cool the NaHCO3 is added.
Liquid cultures should be grown with shaking.

Add to the sterile medium per liter from a 8% filter sterilised stock solution:
 NaHCO3                                                             9.45      ml



Adjust the pH with 1M NaOH or H2SO4 to 8.0-8.4 (after autoclaving and mixing all
solutions the pH should be 8.0-8.4)
