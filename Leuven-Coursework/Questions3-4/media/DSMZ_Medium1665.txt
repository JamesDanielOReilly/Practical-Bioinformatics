Dissolve ingredients (except phosphate buffer, bicarbonate, ferrous chloride, vitamins
and cysteine), adjust pH to 7.2 with NaOH and sparge medium with 100% N2 gas for 30
– 45 min to make it anoxic. Dispense medium under the same gas atmosphere into
anoxic Hungate-type tubes or serum vials and autoclave. After autoclaving add
phosphate buffer, ferrous chloride, vitamins and cysteine from sterile anoxic stock
solutions prepared under 100% N2 gas atmosphere and bicarbonate from a sterile stock
solution prepared under 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture. Vitamins should be sterilized
by filtration. Adjust pH of the complete medium to 7.2 – 7.5 , if necessary.
