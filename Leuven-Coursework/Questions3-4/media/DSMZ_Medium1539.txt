Dissolve ingredients except carbonate, glucose, vitamins, cysteine and sulfide, then
sparge medium with 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture for 30 – 45 min to make it
anoxic. Dispense medium under the same gas atmosphere into anoxic Hungate-type
tubes or serum vials and autoclave. Add glucose, vitamins, cysteine and sulfide from
sterile anoxic stock solutions prepared under 100% N2 gas (vitamins are sterilized by
filtration) and carbonate from a sterile anoxic stock solution prepared under 80% N2 and
20% CO2 gas mixture. Prior to use adjust pH of complete medium to 7.0 - 7.5, if
necessary.
