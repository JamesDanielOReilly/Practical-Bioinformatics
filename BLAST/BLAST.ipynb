    "## Introduction\n",
    "BLAST is an acronym for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool. BLAST is an algorithm for comparing primary biological sequence information. A BLAST search enables a researcher to compare a subject protein or nucleotide sequence (called a query) with a library or database of sequences, and identify library sequences that resemble the query sequence above a certain threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heuristic algorithm it uses is much faster than other approaches, such as calculating an optimal alignment. This emphasis on speed is vital to making the algorithm practical on the huge genome databases currently available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before fast algorithms such as BLAST were developed, searching databases for protein or nucleic sequences was very time consuming because a full alignment procedure (e.g., the Needleman-Wunsch or Smithâ€“Waterman algorithm) was used. The drawback of BLAST compared to Smith-Waterman is that it cannot guarantee optimal alignments, so we trade speed and efficiency for high accuracy and precise results.\n",

    "## Method\n",
    "BLAST finds similar sequences, by locating short matches between the two sequences. This process of finding similar sequences is called seeding. It is after this first match that BLAST begins to make local alignments. While attempting to find similarity in sequences, sets of common letters, known as words, are very important. For example, suppose that the sequence contains the following stretch of letters, GLKFA. If a BLAST was being conducted under normal conditions, the word size would be 3 letters. In this case, using the given stretch of letters, the searched words would be GLK, LKF, KFA. \n",
    "\n",
    "The heuristic algorithm of BLAST locates all common three-letter words between the sequence of interest and the hit sequence or sequences from the database. This result will then be used to build an alignment. After making words for the sequence of interest, the rest of the words are also assembled. These words must satisfy a requirement of having a score of at least the threshold T, when compared by using a scoring matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "One commonly used scoring matrix for BLAST searches is BLOSUM62 (the scoring matrix used with Needleman-Wunsch in this repository), even though the optimal scoring matrix depends on sequence similarity. Once both words and neighborhood words are assembled and compiled, they are compared to the existing sequences in the database in order to find matches. The threshold score T determines whether or not a particular word will be included in the alignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once seeding has been conducted, the alignment which is only 3 residues long, is extended in both directions by the algorithm used by BLAST. Each extension impacts the score of the alignment by either increasing or decreasing it. If this score is higher than a pre-determined T, the alignment will be included in the results given by BLAST. However, if this score is lower than this pre-determined T, the alignment will cease to extend, preventing the areas of poor alignment from being included in the BLAST results. Note that increasing the T score limits the amount of space available to search, decreasing the number of neighborhood words, while at the same time speeding up the process of BLAST"
