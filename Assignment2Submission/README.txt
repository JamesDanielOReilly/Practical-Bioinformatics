!!README!!

This zipped folder contains:
	- Two Python scripts: the main module 'Coursework2.py', and an 'execute.py' script for you to run to see the results
	- The final report
	- A text file with all the answers, formatted for each question. This will only be made when you run 'execute.py'
	- A 'Plots' folder where plots generated in the scripts will be stored
	- A 'TextFiles' folder where text files generated in the scripts will be stored
	- An iPython notebook (with slightly different code) used for writing the scripts originally
	- The .pdb file

INSTRUCTIONS:
	- Run " python execute.py" from the terminal
	- Answers will be shown in an answer file generated by the script
